    <h2>MITER GAUGE TELESCOPING FENCE 18" TO 31"</h2>
    <p>MITER1000HD  Miter Gauge 1000 High Definition - INCRA   The NEW INCRA Miter 1000HD is the most refined model yet in the Miter 1000 series. The HD stands for High Definition; because the protractor plate's exclusive AngleLOCK Indexing System has a whopping 180 can't-miss angle stops in 1 degree increments with special stops located at 22-1/2 degree. Combine that high-resolution protractor with the industry's smoothest adjustable miter bar, a telescoping IncraLOCK Cut-off Fence &amp; Flip Shop Stop, and a steel vernier scale that reads to 1/10 degree, and you've got a winner that will improve the quality of any project. Are you cutting parts for segmented turning? The Miter 1000HD will allow you to precisely set and quickly duplicate any angle you might need, whether it's 18 degree for cutting 10 sides, 25.7 degree for 7-sided objects, or anything else imaginable.  Telescoping IncraLOCK Fence  This Miter Fence telescopes from 18" to a full  31" length and features a front T-slot for adding a wooden zero-clearance sub fence.ÿÿThe Miter 1000HD's Flip Shop Stop is equipped with INCRA's patented incremental positioning racks for incredible cut-length accuracy and 100% day-to-day repeatability.  GlideLOCK Miter Bar   Six expansion disks adjust both sides of the bar for ZERO side play, low-friction travel on all table saws with standard miter gauge channels, including Delta, Craftsman, imports, etc. An excellent fit in the channel directly transfers the Miter 1000HD's incredible accuracy directly to your project. The Miter 1000's adjustable miter bar will fit square-sided miter slots measuring 3/4" wide, 3/8" deep, and with or without a 15/16" T-slot at the bottom. The miter bar's adjustment rangeÿaccommodates actual slot widths between 0.740" and 0.765".   1/10th degree Vernier Cursor  Precision angle indexing teeth are laser cut in solid steel to lock in positive angle stops every 1 degree over a 180 degree range, with special stops at 22-1/2 degree. A stainless steel vernier cursor delivers an incredible 1/10th degree resolution between fixed steps.</p>
