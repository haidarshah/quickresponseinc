From master craftsmen to first-time DIY’ers, this 15oz. advanced glue bottle makes for quick and accurate application. The large size holds enough glue to be your everyday go-to gluing solution. The secret is the two-chamber design. When pressure is applied the glue is sent from the bottom of the storage chamber up through the smaller application chamber. This allows you to control the flow and deliver just the amount of glue you need. It even allows for vertical application – you can put glue anywhere, at any angle! Included with the GlueMate450™ are 2 different application tips. A fine point cone applicator allows you to lay down a fine bead of glue on narrow boards or in dowel holes or other joints. The flat biscuit applicator tip has a wide profile making it great for biscuit joints, or just spreading a wider bead of glue on bigger boards. Features: Double chamber system allows for gluing at any angleNarrow application tube helps you control flow and apply precise amounts of glue2x applicator tips for different occasionsFine cone Applicator for fine beadsFlat biscuit Applicator for wide flat beadsHolds 15 oz. of wood glue or other liquidsFill with your favorite brand of glue!
