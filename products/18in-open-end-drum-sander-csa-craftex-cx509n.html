    <h2>18" OPEN END DRUM SANDER</h2>
    <p>CX509N      18" OPEN END DRUM SANDER We have improved on our original CX509 Drum Sander to bring you the CX509N featuring improved &amp; heavier duty components, mechanics and belt tracking. At a lower price point that traditional drum sanders, this machine offers excellent value to any small to medium workshop. With a small footprint, large sanding capacity &amp; electronic variable speed, this sander will tackle stock up to 36" wide &amp; 4 ½" thick. A key feature to this sander is the table moves up and down instead of the head (like most open end sanders on the market). This means sanding operations are more consistent and rigid.  Ideal for flattening and smoothing wide panels as well as reducing thickness without grain tear-out on a wide range of woods. Once this sander is set up in your shop, you will find all kinds of sanding applications that this open end machine can tackle.  In our rigorous testing on this machine and through a few iterations, we have found this machine to be excellent value. Users should pay close attention to the conveyor belt tracking and take the time to set this up correctly upon first use as well as periodically throughout the life of your machine. Follow the steps laid out in the service manual and this machine will provide you with years of service.
