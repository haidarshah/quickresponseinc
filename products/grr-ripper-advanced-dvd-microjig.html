    <h2>GRR-RIPPER ADVANCED</h2>
    <p>GR200BY  Advanced GRR-Ripper with Push Block - MICROJIG Enjoy the ultimate workshop companion. This advanced model of the GRR-Ripper utilizes all the same innovative features of the GR-100 but comes with two additional accessories that improve the control and expandability of the GRR-Ripper System. The GR200 is built to meet the needs of the professional woodworker or extreme hobbyist. With enhanced versatility features, the GR200 will perform operations that were before very dicey and time-consuming with ease and speed. Whether you are making razor-thin veneer strips, building miniatures, or creating exquisite furniture you will save time, materials, and fingers with the GRR-Ripper.  The GR-200 includes these additional accessories:  THE ADJUSTABLE SPACER - This accessory adds increased gripping surface for tackling larger stock. It also adds one inch of cutting width to the GRR-Ripper. Also, acts as a secondary balance support for small stock and straight-line ripping. Great add-on for working on the Router Table, and eliminating snipe.  THE STABILIZING PLATE - The Stabilizing Plate adds a new dimension of control to the GRR-Ripper. It is particularly useful when cutting small narrow pieces of stock. Perfect for trickier cuts like re-sawing, bevel edging, pattern routing, and much more. The Stabilizing Plate also performs as the secondary fence that travels with the GRR-Ripper along the left side of the stock. It holds the off-cut piece in its original position through the entire cutting operation. Some users call it a "Feather Board Plate" without the force to pinch the stock into the saw blade.</p>
