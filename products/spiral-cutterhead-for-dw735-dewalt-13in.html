    <h2>SPIRAL CUTTERHEAD FOR DEWALT 13"PLANER D</h2>
    <p>Exclusive to Busy Bee Tools, this new spiral cutterhead, with carbide inserts, is designed to fit the DW735 Dewalt Planer. This cutterhead is designed tested and manufactured in the same factory in Taiwan that makes the DW735 Planer so you can feel confident not only in an exact fit, but also in the precision high quality design. With the CX735SPIRAL Cutterhead and the staggered insert design you won't have to worry about replacing your knives when they get chipped as you simply just rotate the insert by 90° to expose a new sharp edge. Every insert is marked with and indicator in one corner allowing you to keep track of how many times that insert has been rotated. Your CX735SPIRAL cutterhead will significantly lessen the noise from your thickness planer during operation as you are no longer having the entire length of the cutterhaed making a single cut, you now have multiple stepped cuts made across the length of the cutterhaed decreasing the noise produced and providing a much smother cleaner finish then your conventional straight knives.  Features: Significantly quieter cuts Significantly reduces tearout 2.5 mm carbide Inserts Replace only damaged inserts by rotating 90° Inserts overlap row to row Includes 5 pc extra insert pack &amp; T Wrench  Specifications: Cutterhead Length: 13" Number of Carbide inserts: 30 Size: 15mm x 15mm x 2.5T</p>
