    <h2>DIGITAL READOUT FOR PLANERS - WIXEY</h2>
    <p>WIXEY DIGITAL READOUT IMPROVED VERSION  The Wixey Planer Digital Readout model WR510 has a new angled display for easy viewing as well as "auto shut off." And like the WR500, it fits most portable woodworking planers.  It easily mounts to Craftex, DeWalt, Makita planer and others. It mounts in minutes and is calibrated in seconds.  It displays the thickness of the wood coming out the back of the planer in inches with fractions or millimeters.  Measuring Length: 6 in. (155mm) Resolution: Decimal = .005 in. Fraction = 1/32 in. Metric = 0.1 mm  Accuracy: Decimal = +/- .0025 in. Fraction = +/- 1/500 in. Metric = +/- .05 mm  Battery: type AAA (requires 2 x AAA batteries NOT INCLUDED)Functions: - Constant memory retains calibration even when OFF - Incremental measuring mode - Absolute measuring mode - Millimeter, Inch and Fraction readout - Auto shut off  Set Up It is easy to attach the Wixey Planer Digital Readout WR510 to your portable planer.It comes with simple mounting brackets and detailed instructions that allow you to mount this on many models without even drilling a single hole.  Calibrate Calibration takes only seconds with its patent pending calibration system. The WR510 Digital Readout uses a piece of freshly planed board to ensure the readout displays the exact thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer  Precise Measurements The large easy to read display reads in inches with fractions or millimeters. The fractions are displayed using "Precise Fraction Technology" which gives you 4 times the accuracy of other fraction readouts.  Easy to Use Once it is set up and calibrated, the WR510 consistently displays the thickness of wood coming out the back of your planer. It never needs re-calibrated unless the battery is re-placed or the blades get worn down. Advanced features let you " zero the blade" "removed a precise amount of material" , or " measure the thickness of any board"</p>
