Many featherboards on the market today apply too much <br>pressure or not enough pressure to the workpiece, resulting in imperfect cuts <br>and less than safe operation. Designed with each finger of the True-FLEXO <br>featherboard to provide a consistent and optimum pressure, and to stand up to <br>years of use in your woodshop. The featherboard is made from an extremely <br>durable plastic composite body and even includes an exclusive wedge-lock system <br>which allows the featherboard to be secured to a variety of shop tools without <br>the need for additional hardware. Whether you're using a miter-slot or <br>a t-slot, working on a table saw or a router table, the wedge-lock system <br>adjusts accordingly and lets you work with confidence <br><br></p>
