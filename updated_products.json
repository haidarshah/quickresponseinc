This advanced model of the GRR-Ripper utilizes all the same innovative features of the GR-100 but comes with two additional accessories that improve the control and expandability of the GRR-Ripper System. The GR200 is built to meet the needs of the professional woodworker or extreme hobbyist. With enhanced versatility features, the GR200 will perform operations that were before very dicey and time-consuming with ease and speed. Whether you are making razor-thin veneer strips, building miniatures, or creating exquisite furniture you will save time, materials, and fingers with the GRR-Ripper.  The GR-200 includes these additional accessories:  THE ADJUSTABLE SPACER\u00a0- This accessory adds increased gripping surface for tackling larger stock. It also adds one inch of cutting width to the GRR-Ripper. Also, acts as a secondary balance support for small stock and straight-line ripping. Great add-on for working on the Router Table, and eliminating snipe.  THE STABILIZING PLATE\u00a0- The Stabilizing Plate adds a new dimension of control to the GRR-Ripper. It is particularly useful when cutting small narrow pieces of stock. Perfect for trickier cuts like re-sawing, bevel edging, pattern routing, and much more. The Stabilizing Plate also performs as the secondary fence that travels with the GRR-Ripper along the left side of the stock. It holds the off-cut piece in its original position through the entire cutting operation. Some users call it a \"Feather Board Plate\" without the force to pinch the stock into the saw blade.",

    "shortDescription": "B3679 The FeatherPro Featherboard developed by Bow Products is a game changer in woodworking tools. Sure you might read that and think that sounds like a lot of hype, but we've got the stats and the features to back it up. Just take a look at some of the features this featherboard provides below, as well as our videos to the left. Currently the FeatherPro fits any table with a 3/8\" x 3/4\" Miter slot. The product ships with aluminum miter bars.  Features: ANTI-KICKBACK LIVING HINGE DESIGN - The FeatherPRO's patented hinge absorbs energy and substantially reduces or arrests the chance of kickback. EASIER / SMOOTHER GLIDE ON INFEED VERSUS PLASTIC OR WOOD FEATHERBOARDS - This is especially true when applying higher pressure. VIBRATION RESISTANCE - You'll achieve higher quality cuts because the feathers absorb vibration so well.  EASIER GLIDE + VIBRATION RESISTANCE = IMPROVED OUTFEED MATERIAL CONTROL - Minimize chatter marks.  HARDENED FOAM FEATHERS - These are especially beneficial if they come in contact with Carbide Blades or Router Bits. Greatly reduces or even avoids shattering the Blade or Bit. Translates to improved safety to woodworkers avoiding shattered material debris. Saves the Blade or Bit.  INTERCHANGEABLE FEATHERS - If you ever make a mistake we've got you covered. Our patented feather design easily swaps out if they ever become damaged.  NON-MARRING FEATHERS - You can apply lots of pressure or a little pressure depending on what you're doing EVEN WHEN working with soft woods! You'll never use a wood or plastic featherboard again.  VERSATILE - You don't need a left and a right. The FeatherPro is reversible by simply flipping it over and reversing hardware. You can also use it in the vertical position, not just horizontal.",
